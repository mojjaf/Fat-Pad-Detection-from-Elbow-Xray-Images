This GitHub project focuses on leveraging end-to-end deep learning techniques for joint effusion detection in elbow fractures using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Joint effusion, a prevalent condition in both adults and children following elbow fractures, is typically diagnosed through radiography. The primary objective of this study is to explore the diagnostic accuracy of deep CNN algorithms in classifying joint effusion in pediatric and adult elbow radiographs. The project provides a comprehensive implementation and evaluation of these deep learning models, aiming to enhance and automate the diagnostic process for elbow injuries through advanced image analysis.
